# Starbucks-Capstone-Project
Udacity Data Science Nanodegree
This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks.

As a challange to be solved that not all users receive the same offer.

# Installation
Python versions 3.*.

# Python libraries:

Pandas

Numpy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Scikit learn



# Project Motivation

This project part of my Data Science Nanodegree, and the objective is to try to find how Starbucks customers use the app, and how well is the current offers system. More importantly, to find patterns and show when and where to give specific offer to a specific customer.


# File Descriptions
data:

portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.).

profile.json - demographic data for each customer.

transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed.
